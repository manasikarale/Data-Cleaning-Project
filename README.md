### Dataset background
The candidate summary file includes a financial summary for any candidate for the House, Senate, or President who has registered with the FEC or is listed on an official state ballot. This data is accessible for the current election as well as previous ones dating back to the 2008 election. There are also special elections for the House and Senate.

In each filing, committees give an overview of their financial activity. The candidate summary file is created by combining these summaries over the course of the whole two-year period. Totals for a candidate's finances include their main campaign committee as well as any additional committees permitted to raise money on their behalf. The totals range from January 1 of the year prior to the election to the date of the committees' most recent report.
